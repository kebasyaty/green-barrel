# mango-orm

ORM-like API MongoDB for Rust

The first version of the crate is not available now. This crate is still WIP.

### Philosophy

We want to provide an ORM based on MongoDB type safe and very easy to use in Rust.

### Next Steps:

- Define the main derive_proc_macro Model that will allow developers to create models with it.
- Add documentation
- Split code

Do not hesitate to contribute.
